                      Kenneth Bowersox, Jr. is an artist driven by a passion for family, heritage, and innovation in a world increasingly shaped by cyberspace. His work bridges tradition and modern creativity, blending hands-on craftsmanship with forward-thinking design.

                      He writes novels, designs and develops original games, and creates fresh, artisanal pieces that reflect both creativity and purpose. Each project—whether a story, a game, or a crafted object—is thoughtfully designed to bring meaning, originality, and character into any home or office.

              Scott Bailey is the craftsman behind the molds, bringing resin to life through experience, curiosity, and innovation. With a passion for creating one-of-a-kind resin products, his work embraces both tradition and experimentation—each piece shaped by thoughtful design and a willingness to explore new techniques.

              Grounded in a “nothing beats a classic” mindset, Bailey balances time-tested methods with an open-minded approach to cutting-edge innovation. The result is resin work that feels both familiar and forward-thinking, defined by quality, character, and originality.

                          <h3>Mission</h3>
                          <p>
                              Our mission is to reconnect families through meaningful creation—bringing game night back to the kitchen table by blending storytelling, craftsmanship, and innovation.
                              Rooted in heritage and driven by creativity, we design and build original games and handcrafted pieces that invite people to slow down, gather together, and engage 
                              beyond screens. Every product we create is intentional, one-of-a-kind, and made to spark connection, conversation, and lasting memories.

                          <h3>Approach</h3>
                          <p>
                              Our approach is rooted in curiosity, craftsmanship, and forward thinking.
                              We don’t follow templates or trends—we question assumptions, explore new methods, and think beyond conventional boundaries. 
                              Every project begins with intent and ends with purpose, guided by hands-on experience and a willingness to push past the expected.
                              By combining classic foundations with outside-the-box thinking, we allow creativity and function to coexist. There are no limits 
                              placed on ideas—only thoughtful standards applied to how they are executed.
                          </p>

                          <h3>Standards</h3>
                          <p>
                              We hold ourselves to standards that go beyond the ordinary.
                              Quality is not optional, precision is not negotiable, and innovation is never pursued at the expense of integrity. 
                              Each game, product, or design is evaluated not only by how it looks, but by how it feels, functions, and endures over time.
                              Our work reflects a no-limits mindset paired with disciplined execution—where imagination is encouraged, details matter,
                              and the final result must stand up to real-world use, real families, and real moments around the table.
